        <h2>OVERVIEW – THE CAYMAN ISLANDS REAL ESTATE MARKET</h2>
        <p>As a highly successful offshore financial centre, the Cayman Islands has one of the strongest economies in
            the Caribbean region. High net worth individuals and businesses are attracted to its tax neutral status and
            one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean. This trio of islands, which is located north-west
            of Jamaica, has much more to offer property buyers too</p>
        <p>.With some of the world’s best beaches, including the famous Seven Mile Beach on the main island Grand Cayman
            and several luxury hotels, the tourism industry has been growing at record levels. Smaller sister islands
            Cayman Brac and Little Cayman offer a slower pace of life and beautiful scenery. All three are renowned for
            some of the best diving in the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>With such a large number of hedge funds, banks and businesses based in the Cayman Islands, the real estate
            market is geared to the top end of the market – much like the nearby BVI. Property for sale includes luxury
            condos and beachfront homes for sale overlooking Grand Cayman’s Seven Mile Beach. Beachfront land for sale
            is also available on Cayman Brac and Little Cayman.</p>
